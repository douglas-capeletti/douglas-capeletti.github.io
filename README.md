## What is this?

* This is my personal website, where I will post my projects and other stuff.
* I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build/) as a static site generator, and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a CSS framework.
* Should I use tailwind? IDK, makes the code messy, but it's faster to develop boring css stuff

## How to run

* Clone this repo
* Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies
* Run `pnpm dev` to start the dev server
* Run `pnpm check` to check for any issues
* Run `pnpm index` to generate the search index
* Run `pnpm build` to build the site

## How to update the diagrams

The diagrams are generated by [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), to update them, just edit the `.puml` files on *diagrams* folder and generate a new diagram using this VsCode [Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) following. Then put the files on the *public/diagrams* folder following the folder pattern.

So search for the command on the VsCode:

``` yaml
PlantUML: Export Workspace Diagrams
```

- Tip: You can create a shortcut fot this on VsCode keybinding

  ``` sh
    ctrl + alt + d
  ```
